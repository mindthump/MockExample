# MockExample

These are intended to be simple, straightforward examples of mocking in
Python, which allow us to examine the values and effects of things like
imports on how objects in need of mocking are named down where they are
used. See Mock (2.7) or mock (3.x+) docs for details.

What I'm after is pragmatic heuristics to get you started, not an in-depth discussion about namespaces and bindings.
